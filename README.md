#MEAN

Mean is an acronym for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. In the world of modern software,
we typically deal with front end and back end. Or server side and client side.

The M from the MEAN acronym. Mongo is a cross platform document oriented database. Meaning it's not like your more traditional SQL database.
Which is where the no SQL term comes from.

The E from the MEAN acronym. Express or Express.js is a no JS web application server framework.
It's the defacto standard server framework for no JS. It allows for quick development of robust web API's by providing a thin and performance focused layer on top of Node. Without obscuring any fundamental Node features.
In other words it's simple, fast and allows you to keep using all the original Node features.
it's simple, fast and allows you to keep using all the original Node features.

Angular. The A from the MEAN acronym. Up until now we have looked at two server side technologies.
Angular is the first and only front end component of the MEAN stack.

Node. The N form the MEAN acronym. Node is an open source cross platform run time environment for developing server side web applications.



we need to intall npm, node, mongodb

node: https://nodejs.org/en/
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/
mongodb:https://www.mongodb.com/
 open console then : mongod to RUN and mongo to open the console
yeomen: npm install  -g yo
Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

Genrator for yeomen:
i will use the gulp-angular generator.
It will save us a lot of time in setting up some tedious tasks that make our development process must faster using gulp

It needs to install gulp : Automate and enhance your workflow

npm install -g gulp

if this command doesn't work use : sudo npm install -g gulp

Also we need to install #bower : Bower is a package manager that we will use for the front end and to get packages that work with Angular.
npm install -g bower

now lets install the generator we spoke about:
npm install -g generator-gulp-angular

It may require sudo also.

Now after cloning the project.

open the project folder using console and then write this command :

gulp
after it you need to write:
gulp serve 

and now the project will run on your local host :) . taraaaaaa
