#MEAN

Mean is an acronym for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. In the world of modern software,
we typically deal with front end and back end. Or server side and client side.

The M from the MEAN acronym. Mongo is a cross platform document oriented database. Meaning it's not like your more traditional SQL database.
Which is where the no SQL term comes from.

The E from the MEAN acronym. Express or Express.js is a no JS web application server framework.
It's the defacto standard server framework for no JS. It allows for quick development of robust web API's by providing a thin and performance focused layer on top of Node. Without obscuring any fundamental Node features.
In other words it's simple, fast and allows you to keep using all the original Node features.

Angular. The A from the MEAN acronym. Up until now we have looked at two server side technologies.
Angular is the first and only front end component of the MEAN stack.

Node. The N form the MEAN acronym. Node is an open source cross platform run time environment for developing server side web applications.
